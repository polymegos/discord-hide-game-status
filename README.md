# Hide Discord Game Status (Selective)

[GreasyFork.org](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/534197-hide-discord-game-status-selective)

This userscript hides the **game-playing status** of Discord users - **but only if you’ve closed DMs with them**.<br>
It's a simple way to declutter Discord’s interface and reduce mental noise. If someone’s game status matters to you, just open your DMs with them and it will be shown again, person by person, intentionally.

## Why Use It?

Tired of seeing everyone playing games when you're trying to focus?  
This script keeps your Discord cleaner - **without blocking or muting friends.**

## How It Works

- If DMs are **closed** with someone: their game status is hidden
- If DMs are **open**: their game status shows normally
- You control who you care to see, one click at a time

## Features

- Hides game/activity status ("Playing X") from user popouts and profile cards
- Respects your attention: shows status if DMs are open
- Works automatically in the background
- Lightweight and non-intrusive

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
2. Install the script from [GreasyFork.org](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/534197-hide-discord-game-status-selective).
